heuristics:
  - heur_id: 1
    name: Multiple TLS Callbacks Detected
    score: 100
    filetype: "executable/windows"
    description: The PE file contains more than one TLS callbacks. Multiple TLS callbacks are rare in legitimate software but common in malware for executing code before the main entry point to evade detection.
  - heur_id: 2
    name: VirtualAlloc with Execute/Write Permissions
    score: 200
    filetype: "executable/windows"
    description: The PE file allocates memory with both execute and write permissions. Malware often allocates memory with execute permissions to inject code.
  - heur_id: 3
    name: Loads Potentially Suspicious DLL
    score: 300
    filetype: "executable/windows"
    description: The PE file loads a DLL using either 'LoadLibraryA' or 'LoadLibraryW' that is specified in the SUS_DLLS configuration variable.
  - heur_id: 4
    name: High Number of GetProcAddress Calls
    score: 400
    filetype: "executable/windows"
    description: The PE file makes excessive number of calls to GetProcAddress in the second half of execution. Malware often dynamically resolves APIs late in execution after unpacking/decryption.
  - heur_id: 5
    name: Calls Suspicious API Function
    score: 300
    filetype: "executable/windows"
    description: The PE file calls an API function that is specified in the SUS_APIS configuration variable.
  - heur_id: 6
    name: Dynamic Code Segments Detected
    score: 130
    filetype: "executable/windows"
    description: The PE file creates or modifies code segments at runtime. Malware often generates code at runtime to evade static analysis.
  - heur_id: 7
    name: Shellcode Detected
    score: 1000
    filetype: "*"
    description: File is a shellcode blob and successfully emulated.
  - heur_id: 8
    name: Shellcode Network Activity Detected
    score: 1000
    filetype: "*"
    description: Shellcode successfully performed network activity.
